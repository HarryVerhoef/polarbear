# polarbear
A C++ compiler for a fresh new mathematical language

This markdown is essentially a place for syntax design decisions, and as such, the structure is quite erratic. 

## Types

Types in polarbear can be defined in two ways:
- Simple types

  polarbear allows simple types to be defined concisely, with just a set of values, all of which are publicly accessible. Simple types have no member methods or **explicit** supertypes.

  - **Enum types**
    
    polarbear enums are defined by instantiating a type variable with a set of undeclared identifiers. Once an enum type has been defined, the composing elements can be referred to by name, within scope, and the type variable itself functions in the same way as a regular set; polarbear enums are mutable and iterable.

    ```javascript
    type bearfood = {roots, berries, seals, insects};
    type colour = {black, white, red, blue};
    ```

    Note: It is important to remember that due to the properties of sets, ***the order of the elements is not conserved***.
  - **Simple types**

    Simple types differ from enums in that the elements of the value set are not arbitrary. These values can be literals, variables, functions, etc.

     ```javascript 
     type posint = {n : for n in int where n >= 0};
     ```

    Note: this specific example is a good example of a type which is an implicit subtype (of the int type), since posint is a subset of int. Consequently, a posint type can be safely cast to an int.

- Complex types
    
    Complex types offer much more functionality, with the addition of access specifiers, member functions, and implicit value sets.

    ```javascript
    type bear {
        private:
            string name;
            posint age;
        public:
            bear(string name, posint age) {
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
            }
            string getName() {
                return this.name;
            }
            void setName(string name) {
                this.name = name;
            }
            posint getAge() {
                return this.age;
            }
            void setAge(posint age) {
                this.age = age;
            }
            
    }
    ```
    With complex types, the value set is the set of all possible instances, which is determined by the set of all possible combinations of stateful member variables. The value set for each complex type is calculated and stored implicitly. The value set of any given complex type can be obtained through the ***vset()*** method.

    ```javascript
    > bear.vset();
    > {bear(a,b) : for a in string for b in posint}
    ```

    In contrast to simple types, type inheritance must be **explicit**, and is done like so:

    ```javascript
    type polarbear : bear {
        private:
            set diet = {seals};
            colour furColour = white;
        public:
            polarbear(string name, posint age) {
                this.setName(name);
                this.setAge(age);
            }
            set getDiet() {
                return this.diet;
            }
            colour getFurColour() {
                return this.furColour;
            }
    }
    ```
    Any instance of the polarbear type inherits the member functions of the bear method, since it is a subtype. Moreover, the type definition of polarbear can extend the bear type with more functions and variables. Consequently, since a polarbear is still a bear, the value set of a bear must also be extended.

    ```javascript
    > bear.vset();
    > {
        bear(a,b) : for a in string for b in posint,
        polarbear(a,b) : for a in string for b in posint
      }
    ```

    If you really fancy yourself, you can define operators to be used with your complex type, as so:

    ```javascript
    op("+", bear b1, bear b2) {
        return bear(b1.getName() + " jr", 0);
    }
    ```

    Here, we have made it so that the application of the "+" operator to two bear types returns a new bear instance, with the string " jr" concatenated on to the name of the first bear, and age 0.





### Built in types

There are few built-in types in polarbear, it is encouraged that users define their own as needed.

 - ``` int ```
 - ``` real ```
 - ``` bool ```
 - ``` char ```
 - ``` string ```
 - ``` set ```
 - ``` array ```


#### Sets

Set-theory forms the basis for most theoretical computational mathematics. Some of the most famous and important algorithms are implemented first and foremost using sets. Sets have three main properties:

 - Elements are unordered.
 - There are no duplicate elements.
 - Elements do not have to be of the same type.

Here are some examples of different ways to define sets in polarbear:

```javascript
set emptySet = {};
set learningAlphabet = {'a', "ab", "abc"};
set rationals = { a/b : for a in int for b in int};
```

As is shown, sets can be intialised by specifying each individual element, or, by using a production and a set of conditions.

Conveniently, there are also a load of built-in set operators in polarbear!

 - ```/\``` - Intersection
 - ```\/``` - Union
 - ``` - ``` - Difference
 - ```*``` - Cartesian product
 - ```in``` - is a subset/element of

Here are some examples!

```javascript
> {'a', 'b', 'c'} /\ {'b', 'c', 'd'};
> {'b', 'c'}
```

```javascript
> {'a', 'b', 'c'} \/ {'b', 'c', 'd'};
> {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
```

```javascript
> {'a', 'b', 'c'} - {'b', 'c', 'd'};
> {'a'}
```

```javascript
> {'a', 'b'} * {'b', 'c'};
> {('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('b', 'b'), ('b', 'c')}
```

```javascript
> {'a', 'b', 'c'} in {'b', 'c', 'd'};
> false
```

```javascript
> 'c' in {'b', 'c', 'd'};
> true
```

This makes it easier for us to define even more sets!

```javascript
set irr = real - rationals;
```
Note: In polarbear, all types can be used as sets, and all sets can be used as types!

```javascript
type irr = irrationals;
```

Sets can also be iterated over:

```javascript
for (x : posint) {
    out(x);
}
```
This for-loop would output all integers greater than or equal to 0.

#### Numbers

In contrast to most modern languages, which implement a set of built-in number types closely related to their literal properties (signed, double, float, etc.)

In polarbear, a more abstract and mathematical approach is taken. There are two built-in number types: ```int``` and ```real```, representing integers and real numbers respectively. As is seen across this markdown document, different number types can be defined extremely concisely that more specificly define the set of numbers you desire.

```javascript
int n = 0;
real k = 1.234;
```

#### Characters and strings

Characters are single-character identifiers surrounded by single quotes:
```javascript
string s = "ab";
```

Characters and strings can be used together harmoniously:

```javascript
> s += 'c';
> out(s);
> abc
```
In polarbear, strings are mutable and iterable, since essentially they are an array of characters.

```javascript
for (char c : s) {
    out(c);
}
```

```javascript
a
b
c
```

Data can be embed into strings using ```{}``` like so:


```javascript
> polarbear mickey = polarbear("mickey", 1);
> out("{mickey.getName()} is a {mickey.getAge()} year old polar bear.");
> mickey is a 1 year old polar bear.
```

## Functions

Functions in polarbear are defined like so:

```javascript
/* f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2 */
int f(int x) {
    return (x ** 2) + (3 * x) + 2;
}

/* g(x) = x(x - 1) */
int g(int x) {
    return x * (x - 1);
}

/* h(x) = x + 2 */
int h(int x) {
    return x + 2;
}
```
Functions are very powerful in polarbear, with features such as functional equivalence and composite functions.

### Functional Equivalence

Let ```f``` and ```g``` be two functions of the same type that take the same parameters, where ```I``` denotes the set of all possible parameters. ```f``` and ```g``` are functionally equivalent over input set ```I``` if and only if for all ```i``` which is an element of ```I```, ```f(i) = g(i)```.

In polarbear, the ```<==>``` operator is used to denote functional equivalence over ```I```, the set of all possible inputs.

However, for functions whose ```I``` is infinite (like the functions defined earlier), a functional equivalence operator with a restricted domain is more pragmatic. This is written like ```<={J}=>```, where ```J``` is the set representing the restricted domain. Note that if ```J``` is not a subset of ```I```, an error will be thrown, since all elements of ```J``` must be valid inputs to both functions.

### Composite Functions

For any two functions ```a``` and ```b```, ```a.b(x)``` is functionally equivalent to ```a(b(x))```

Using these two features of functions, and using the function definitions earlier:
```javascript
> type someInts = {n : for n in int where n > -5000 /\ n < 5000};
> f <==> g.h;
> error: Cannot compare functions whose domain is infinite.
> f <={someInts}=> g.h;
> true
```

To elaborate further, ```f(x) = g(h(x))``` is a true statement for all integers ```x```, and therefore ```f(x) <==> g(h(x))```. But polarbear cannot verify this, and so a subdomain must be used.

### Other comparison operators

On top of the functional equivalence operator, there are some more function comparison mechanisms in polarbear:

- ```>``` Greater than
- ```>=``` Greater than or equal to
- ```<``` Less than
- ```<=``` Less than or equal to

And again, these can be suffixed by a subdomain.

```javascript
> f > h
> error: Cannot compare functions whose domain is infinite.
> f >{{0,1,2,3}} h
> false
```
While ```f > h``` is true for 1, 2, and 3, ```f(0) = h(0) = 2``` and so the comparison evaluates to false.

### Entry point

In polarbear, the entry point is the **main** method, which can take no parameters, or an array of arguments, as is shown:

```javascript
void main(array<string> args) {
    /* Code */
}
```
